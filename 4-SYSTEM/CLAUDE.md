# CLAUDE.md — 🛤️ Railroads

Persistent operational instructions for an LLM agent working in this vault. Read before touching any file.

---

## ⚑ Before doing anything — check for a skill first

**This is the single most important rule in this file.**

1. Open `4-SYSTEM/Skills/SKILLS-CATALOG.md` and scan for a skill that matches the task.
2. If a match exists, open its `SKILL.md` in full and follow the execution steps exactly — do not improvise.
3. Only if no skill exists should you proceed using the general rules below.

Skipping this step is the most common agent error in this vault. The skills exist precisely to ensure consistency and correct citation format. A task done without its skill must be redone.

---

This file is the **operational quick-reference**. The canonical rules for each folder live in that folder's README:

- [`../1-SOURCES/About Sources.md`](../1-SOURCES/About%20Sources.md) — sources rules in full
- [`../2-RAILS/About Rails.md`](../2-RAILS/About%20Rails.md) — rails schema in full
- [`../3-TRANSFORMATIONS/About Transformations.md`](../3-TRANSFORMATIONS/About%20Transformations.md) — transformations rules in full

When this file and a folder README disagree, the folder README wins.

## 1. What this vault is

**Railroads** is a method for making AI-powered work on classical texts reliable. Instead of feeding a model raw commentary and hoping it synthesises correctly, we lay the **rails** first: structured, machine-readable context packages that resolve every ambiguity in a passage and cite the human source for each decision. Once the rails are laid, any model can run any transformation — translation, adaptation, lesson plan, daily reading, study guide, anything — without redoing the philological work.

Authority comes from the human source — for this vault, the canonical text and its **authoritative translations**, never from the LLM's parametric knowledge.

**This vault is an anthology, not a single text.** It serves **WeBuddhist Verse of the Day** — buddhavacana across the Pali Canon, Chinese Āgamas, and Tibetan Kangyur (sūtra sections; no tantra/Vinaya/scholastic). It holds **no commentaries**, so rails are **translation-grounded** via the `verse-rail` skill (use it, not `verse-context`, which is commentary-centric and superseded here). Per-source addressing, the licensing register, and all deviations are in [`Guidelines/vault-annex.md`](Guidelines/vault-annex.md) — read §0 first.

## 2. Folder structure and citation chain

```
0-INBOX/        # drafts and scratch — not authoritative
1-SOURCES/      # human-produced material — read-only ground truth
  Text/         # root texts
  Commentaries/ # commentaries on the text
  Translations/ # existing translations (block-aligned with the root)
  References/   # dictionaries, secondary literature
  Audio/        # recitation and teaching recordings
2-RAILS/        # compiled interpretive context (primary work area)
  Sections/     # multi-commentary summaries per TOC node
  Verses/       # verse-level context files
  Local-Wiki/   # monolingual articles per key term
  Bilingual-Glossaries/ # bilingual descriptive glossaries per language pair
3-TRANSFORMATIONS/      # AI-generated outputs, organised in three categories
  Translations/ # language-by-language translation tracks
  Adaptations/  # audience-targeted retellings (children's, scholarly, …)
  Plans/        # calendar-driven study/practice arcs
4-SYSTEM/       # guidelines, skills, templates — read-only
```

### Citation chain — never skip a link

```
1-SOURCES/ → 2-RAILS/ → 3-TRANSFORMATIONS/
```

- `2-RAILS/` cites `1-SOURCES/` only — never another rail file, never parametric knowledge, never `3-TRANSFORMATIONS/`.
- `3-TRANSFORMATIONS/` cites `2-RAILS/` only — never reaching past the rails directly into the sources. (Plan tracks may also embed other completed `3-TRANSFORMATIONS/` outputs — recorded the same way in `context_packages:`.)

If a claim cannot be cited, do not make it. Leave the field blank and mark `status: draft`.

### Write permissions

| Folder | LLM may write? |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `0-INBOX/` | yes — scratch only, never cited from elsewhere |
| `1-SOURCES/` | **no** — only metadata additions via skill workflows |
| `2-RAILS/` | yes — primary work area |
| `3-TRANSFORMATIONS/`| yes — only when explicitly instructed |
| `4-SYSTEM/` | **no** — rule changes require a human contributor |

The `1-SOURCES/` restriction is the most important. The folder receives human material once, has its block IDs and frontmatter added under controlled skills, and is then frozen. Adding interpretation here — even a paraphrase or a glossing parenthetical — corrupts the ground truth and breaks the citation chain.

---

## 3. Descriptive `2-RAILS/`, prescriptive `3-TRANSFORMATIONS/`

- **`2-RAILS/` is descriptive.** It distills and reformats what is already attested in `1-SOURCES/` — root text, commentaries, existing translations — without adding choices. Every claim cites a specific human source. The authority of a rail comes from the tradition it compiles, not from the LLM that compiled it.
- **`3-TRANSFORMATIONS/` is prescriptive.** It contains the choices that guide AI-powered output for *each particular track* — audience, register, the rendering chosen for every keyword, the per-session shape. Where `2-RAILS/` records what translators *have done*, `3-TRANSFORMATIONS/` records what *this* output *will do*.

---

## 4. File naming

- Lowercase, hyphenated, no diacritics in filenames. Diacritics fine inside file content and frontmatter.
- Language tag suffix on every file carrying language-specific material: `-pi` Pāli, `-sk` Sanskrit, `-bo` Tibetan, `-zh` Chinese, `-en` English. Add a script suffix when needed: `-sk-iast`, `-bo-wy`. Full tag list in [`../1-SOURCES/About Sources.md`](../1-SOURCES/About%20Sources.md) §12.
- Verse package files in `2-RAILS/Verses/` are named by block ID without the caret: `1-1.md`, `6-33.md`. Section files in `2-RAILS/Sections/` are named by node ID: `1.md`, `1-1.md`.
- Local-wiki files use `term_(disambiguating-phrase).md`.

---

## 5. Block IDs — the verse-level link

Every verse or discrete prose block in `1-SOURCES/` ends with an Obsidian block ID. This is the sole mechanism for cross-file references at the verse level across the vault.

```
[verse text here] ^1-1
```

- Format: `^chapter-verse` (most common), `^verse`, or `^book-chapter-verse` — declared per file in the `verse_id_format` frontmatter field.
- Numbers are not zero-padded. Use natural numbers (`^1-583`, not `^01-0583`).
- The vault annex ([`Guidelines/vault-annex.md`](Guidelines/vault-annex.md)) specifies the addressing scheme for the root text(s) of this vault.

Link form: `[[1-SOURCES/Text/[lang]-root-text.md#^1-1]]`
Transclude: `![[1-SOURCES/Text/[lang]-root-text.md#^1-1]]`

Use full paths in all `1-SOURCES/` and `2-RAILS/` files. Short wiki links are acceptable only inside `4-SYSTEM/` documentation.

---

## 5a. Heading hierarchy for source text files

Headings are **editorial structure added to the original text** — they are not themselves original content. To mark this distinction and prevent any collision with verse/block IDs, every heading block ID ends with **`-0`** (the zero slot is reserved for the heading; original content always starts at `1`).

| Level | Markdown | Purpose | Block ID format | Example |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `#` | Title of the work | none | `# [Title of the work]` |
| 2 | `##` | Chapter | `^N-0` | `## 1. [Chapter title] ^1-0` |
| 3 | `###` | Section (from author's own TOC) | `^N-N-0` | `### 1.2 [Section title] ^1-2-0` |
| 4 | `####` | Sub-section | `^N-N-N-0` | `#### 1.2.3 [Sub-section title] ^1-2-3-0` |

Content blocks beneath a heading use the same numeric path but replace the trailing `0` with the sequential block number starting at `1`:

```
## 0. Introduction ^0-0

[pre-chapter / homage / colophon block] ^0-1

## 1. [Chapter 1 title] ^1-0

[first verse or prose block of chapter 1] ^1-1

### 1.2 [Section title] ^1-2-0

First prose block here. ^1-2-1
Second prose block here. ^1-2-2
```

Rules:
- The `#` title line takes **no** block ID.
- `##` headings use `^N-0`. Chapter `0` is always the pre-chapter introduction (`## 0. Introduction ^0-0`).
- `###` headings use `^N-N-0`, where the first segment is the parent chapter and the second is the section's ordinal within that chapter.
- `####` headings use `^N-N-N-0`.
- The `0` in the final position is **reserved** for the heading; original-text blocks always start at `1`.
- IDs must not exceed four segments (three path segments + the `0`); flatten deeper structures.
- No zero-padding on any segment.

---

## 5b. Inline TOC phrases — wikilink tagging

Buddhist texts frequently contain **inline structural announcements**: sentences where the author enumerates the upcoming sections before elaborating each one. These phrases are original content (not editorial additions), but they are also the textual source of the TOC headings. Tagging them makes the connection explicit and enables backlink navigation across the vault.

**Convention:** wrap each announced term in a wikilink pointing to the block ID of the heading it sources.

```markdown
## [Chapter title] ^1-0
This chapter has two parts: [[#^1-1-0|the brief teaching]] and [[#^1-2-0|the extended explanation]].

### [Brief teaching] ^1-1-0
[[#^1-1-0|The brief teaching]] is as follows: …

### [Extended explanation] ^1-2-0
[[#^1-2-0|The extended explanation]] runs as follows: …
```

Rules:
- In the **enumeration sentence**, each announced term links forward to its corresponding section heading: `[[#^N-N-0|term]]`.
- In the **body of each section**, the repetition of the section title links to its own heading: `[[#^N-N-0|term]]`. This is self-referential by design — it tags the phrase as the textual source of that heading.
- For cross-file links (e.g. a commentary tagging terms from the root text structure): `[[filename#^N-N-0|term]]`.
- Use the minimal display text — just the structural term itself, not the full grammatical phrase.
- These wikilinks are the only inline tagging mechanism. Do not use italics, HTML spans, or Dataview fields for this purpose.

**Why self-referential links are correct:** clicking a self-link inside its own section scrolls you to the heading of that section — a minor navigation no-op. The value is in the backlinks panel: every file that tags a phrase with `#^1-1-0` becomes visible on that heading, revealing where the structure was announced across all commentaries and translations in the vault.

---

## 6. `1-SOURCES/` — what you may and may not do

Files here are received material — formatted for navigation, never interpreted. Permitted additions only:

- Block IDs
- Frontmatter metadata
- Internal navigation links
- Editorial notes marked `[Ed:...]` (English, factual only)

Any interpretive claim — compound analysis, sense choice, syntactic reading — belongs in `2-RAILS/`, not here.

### Minimum frontmatter

```yaml
---
title:
author:
language:
file_type: root-text | commentary | translation | reference
lang_tag:
source_description: "where this text came from"
---
```

Add external IDs when available: `bdrc_work_id`, `cbeta_id`, `gretil_url`, `dsbc_url`, `suttacentral_id`, `acip_id`.

For commentaries and translations, also include `root_text:` (path) and `covers_verses:` (range, e.g. `1-1–1-1616`).

Full rules in [`../1-SOURCES/About Sources.md`](../1-SOURCES/About%20Sources.md).

---

## 7. `2-RAILS/` — what each subfolder produces

### `Sections/` — per-TOC-node summaries

Each node of the table of contents gets a summary in the original language drawn directly from each relevant commentary. Each commentary's summary is its own file under `Sections/Raw/<commentary>/`. The combined file `Sections/<node-id>.md` synthesises the per-commentary summaries and adds an English translation underneath.

Authoring skills: `section-summary-raw`, `section-summary-combined`.

### `Verses/` — per-verse context packages

One file per verse: `2-RAILS/Verses/<verse-id>.md`. Each package (1) transcludes the relevant commentary passages, (2) synthesises the commentators' interpretations in the original language, and (3) produces a **disambiguated restatement of the verse in the original language** — precise enough that no misreading or mistranslation is possible. Transformation skills work from this disambiguated version, not from the raw verse.

Only `status: complete` packages are used to generate transformations. Domain specialists set `complete` — the LLM never marks its own output complete.

Authoring skill: `verse-context`.

### `Local-Wiki/` — per-term articles

One page per attested sense ID within this text. Sense IDs are Wikipedia-style: `term (disambiguating phrase)`. Each article holds verbatim commentary quotations defining the term, a short contextual definition synthesised from them, and divergence flags where commentaries disagree. All content in the original language.

Authoring skill: `local-wiki-article`.

### `Bilingual-Glossaries/` — bilingual descriptive glossaries

One consolidated file per language pair: `[src]-[tgt].md`. Each entry maps a source lemma to every attested target-language rendering, frequency-ranked across all existing translations.

Raw inputs sit under `Bilingual-Glossaries/Raw/`: one interlinear gloss file per translation, and one per-translation raw bilingual glossary extracted from it. The consolidated file merges them.

Authoring skills: `interlinear-gloss`, `glossary-extract-raw`, `glossary-combine`.

---

## 8. Divergences — never flatten

When commentaries disagree, record the disagreement explicitly:

- Mark with ⚑ in any field where the divergence shows up.
- Add a `### Divergences` section attributing each position to its source.

If traditions teach genuinely incompatible doctrine on a verse, do not synthesise. Record both positions and add to frontmatter:

```yaml
transformation_note: "tradition must be specified for this verse"
```

---

## 9. `3-TRANSFORMATIONS/` — three categories, per-track governance

Three top-level categories, each a top-level subfolder:

- **`Translations/`** — language-by-language translations. Each track has `requirements.md` + `termbase.md` + `audience.md` + the generated translation file(s).
- **`Adaptations/`** — audience-targeted retellings. Each track has `requirements.md`, `audience.md`, and optionally `termbase.md`.
- **`Plans/`** — calendar-driven study/practice arcs. Each plan is language-stratified: one subfolder per published language, each containing `requirements.md`, `termbase.md`, `schedule.md`, `days/`, `communications/`, and `assets/`. The plan root holds only `About <plan-name>.md`.

**Translation / Adaptation contracts:**

- **`requirements.md`** — style contract, written in the target language.
- **`termbase.md`** — vocabulary contract (one rendering per keyword).
- **`audience.md`** — audience profile (demographics, prior knowledge, use cases, motivations).

**Plan contracts:**

- **`About <plan-name>.md`** — cross-language overview: session shape, language list, source-rail dependencies.
- **`<lang>/requirements.md`** — per-language style contract, written in that language.
- **`<lang>/termbase.md`** — per-language vocabulary contract.
- **`<lang>/schedule.md`** — day-by-day calendar for that language stream.

Do not generate from rails whose `status` is not `complete`.

Full rules in [`../3-TRANSFORMATIONS/About Transformations.md`](../3-TRANSFORMATIONS/About%20Transformations.md).

---

## 10. Style and language rules

- Analysis language is English throughout `2-RAILS/` (except per-commentary summaries and verse syntheses, which stay in the original language).
- Quote original-language terms in the appropriate romanisation or script — italicised on first use.
- **No parametric knowledge.** If you cannot cite a claim to a file in `1-SOURCES/`, do not include it.
- **No consensus flattening.** When commentaries disagree, say so.
- Present tense for analytical claims; past tense for historical statements.
- Use registered short IDs for commentaries throughout (e.g. the IDs in [`Guidelines/vault-annex.md`](Guidelines/vault-annex.md) §Commentaries).

---

## 11. Standard operations

**Ingest a passage**
1. Confirm the source is in `1-SOURCES/`.
2. Open or create the verse package in `2-RAILS/Verses/`.
3. Populate the synthesis, disambiguated restatement, and word/translation notes — each field cited.
4. Update or create local-wiki pages for any new sense IDs.
5. Flag divergences with ⚑.

**Lint a rails file**
- Any field in `2-RAILS/` without a `1-SOURCES/` citation → mark `status: draft`.
- Any ⚑ flag without a Divergences entry → add one.
- Any `status: complete` package that fails the checklist in `2-RAILS/About Rails.md` → revert to `partial`.

**Generate a transformation**
1. Confirm all relevant rails are `status: complete`.
2. Load `requirements.md`, `termbase.md`, and `audience.md` for the track.
3. For each batch: load section + verse rails → generate → record `context_packages:` in frontmatter → set `status: draft`.
4. Run `translation-qa` (or equivalent QA skill); iterate until no critical/major errors.
5. Domain specialist sets `status: complete`.

## 12. Skills — always check before starting work

**Before beginning any vault task, check whether a skill already exists for it.**

Skills are reusable, step-by-step procedures stored in `4-SYSTEM/Skills/`. Each skill has its own subfolder containing a `SKILL.md` that specifies exactly how to execute that operation. Following the skill ensures consistency and correct citation format across all vault files.

### Where to look

1. **Catalog first:** `4-SYSTEM/Skills/SKILLS-CATALOG.md` — lists every skill, its purpose, inputs, outputs, and a link to its `SKILL.md`.
2. **Skill folder:** `4-SYSTEM/Skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` — the full execution instructions for a specific skill.

### How to use a skill

1. Read `4-SYSTEM/Skills/SKILLS-CATALOG.md` to find the skill that matches the task.
2. Open and read the relevant `SKILL.md` in full before touching any vault file.
3. Follow the execution steps in the `SKILL.md` exactly — do not improvise the format.
4. If no skill exists for the task, proceed using the general rules in this file, and flag to the human contributor that a new skill may be worth writing.

### Key skills and when to use them
