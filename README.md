# [text-slug]-rails

A collaborative [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault that makes AI-powered work on a **classical text** reliable, traceable, and consistent at scale.

> **Using this template:** Replace every `[text-slug]` placeholder with your text's slug (e.g. `bodhisattvacharyavatara`, `mulamadhyamakakarika`). Fill in the per-vault annex at `4-SYSTEM/Guidelines/vault-annex.md` with the conventions specific to your text. Then delete this note.

## Why

AI models are powerful but unreliable at scale. Hand a model a classical text and a stack of commentary and ask for a translation, an adaptation, a study guide, or a daily reading, and what comes back looks fluent but is hard to trust:

- **Hallucinations** — fabricated meanings that sound plausible.
- **Inconsistency** — the same technical term rendered three different ways across one document.
- **Style drift** — register shifts as the context window fills.
- **No traceability** — no way to verify whether any specific claim is grounded in the commentary tradition or invented on the spot.
- **Doesn't scale** — every new output rediscovers the same interpretive work from scratch.

These failures aren't because the model is weak. They happen because the model is being asked to be **two different specialists at once** — a source-language domain expert who understands every nuance the commentary tradition has worked out, *and* a target-language stylist who knows how to render that meaning for a specific audience. With no preparation and no division of labour, it tries to do both jobs at generation time, in the same prompt, from raw sources. The drift is structural.

## How

The fix is to separate the two specialists, then let them collaborate.

**`2-RAILS/` is the source-language specialist, made permanent.** A pre-built, citation-grounded knowledge base of the commentary tradition — every sense distinction, every compound analysis, every commentator's reading — compiled once, by an LLM under domain-specialist review, with every claim citing the human source that grounds it.

**Each track in `3-TRANSFORMATIONS/` is a target-language specialist for one audience.** A Translation track is a specialist in writing for a particular language and readership. An Adaptation track is a specialist in writing for a particular format (children's, scholarly, sermon). A Plan track is a specialist in pacing a study arc along a calendar. Each one is bound by its own `requirements.md` (style contract) and `termbase.md` (vocabulary contract).

Two principles hold the collaboration together:

- **Descriptive rails, prescriptive transformations.** The source specialist *describes* what the tradition attests: every commentator, every translator, every attested rendering. Each target specialist *prescribes* what *their* output does for *their* audience.
- **One-way citation chain.** `1-SOURCES/ → 2-RAILS/ → 3-TRANSFORMATIONS/`. Target specialists cite the source specialist; they never reach past the rails into raw commentary.

This is what makes the methodology scale. The expensive interpretive work happens once, in `2-RAILS/`, and is amortised over every output ever produced from the vault. **Lay the rails once; run many transformations on them.**

For the full reasoning — the specialist-pair and Wikipedia analogies — see [`4-SYSTEM/Guidelines/why-rails.md`](4-SYSTEM/Guidelines/why-rails.md).

## What

The vault is a four-stage pipeline. Each stage has its own folder; each folder's `About <Folder>.md` is the authoritative source on what goes in it and how.

```
1-SOURCES/   →   2-RAILS/   →   3-TRANSFORMATIONS/
human            original-       per-output prescriptive
authoritative    language        rails plus the

```

- **[`1-SOURCES/`](1-SOURCES/)** — root texts, commentaries, existing translations, audio, references. Read-only ground truth.
- **[`2-RAILS/`](2-RAILS/)** — original-language descriptive context at every level a transformation might need: section summaries, verse packages, per-term wiki articles, bilingual glossaries. Every claim cites `1-SOURCES/`.
- **[`3-TRANSFORMATIONS/`](3-TRANSFORMATIONS/)** — three categories of output (**Translations**, **Adaptations**, **Plans**). Each track is governed by `requirements.md` (style contract) + `termbase.md` (vocabulary contract); the AI-generated output files sit alongside, citing the rails.
- **[`4-SYSTEM/`](4-SYSTEM/)** — skills and workflows for every stage of the pipeline, plus cross-cutting methodology docs and templates.

This vault serves **[name of text]**. Vault-specific conventions (addressing scheme, registered commentary IDs, language tracks) live in [`4-SYSTEM/Guidelines/vault-annex.md`](4-SYSTEM/Guidelines/vault-annex.md).

### If you are an AI agent

1. [`4-SYSTEM/CLAUDE.md`](4-SYSTEM/CLAUDE.md) — operational instructions: citation chain, write permissions, do-nots, standard operations. Read in full before touching any file.
2. The `About <Folder>.md` for the folder you're working in — [`1-SOURCES/About Sources.md`](1-SOURCES/About%20Sources.md), [`2-RAILS/About Rails.md`](2-RAILS/About%20Rails.md), or [`3-TRANSFORMATIONS/About Transformations.md`](3-TRANSFORMATIONS/About%20Transformations.md). Each is the canonical authority for that folder's rules.
3. [`4-SYSTEM/Guidelines/vault-annex.md`](4-SYSTEM/Guidelines/vault-annex.md) — vault-specific conventions.
4. The relevant `4-SYSTEM/Skills/<skill>/SKILL.md` for the specific task.

`AGENTS.md` files exist for tooling that expects them ([`4-SYSTEM/gemini-scribe/AGENTS.md`](4-SYSTEM/gemini-scribe/AGENTS.md)) — they are thin pointers to `CLAUDE.md` and the folder docs.
